AppMenu Window Title
====================

Gnome-Shell extension that shows the current focused window's title. It doesn't
replace the current AppButton, just changes it's label.

This extension is based on
[Status Title Bar] (https://github.com/emerinohdz/StatusTitleBar)
extension, written by
[Edgar Merino] (https://github.com/emerinohdz),
but is much simpler.

Note
----

For best results, use the extension
[Extend left box] (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/51/extend-left-box)
by [Stephen Zhang] (https://github.com/StephenPCG).
